CGI::URI2param - convert parts of an URL to param values

DESCRIPTION

CGI::URI2param takes a request object (as supplied by CGI.pm or
Apache::Request) and a hashref of keywords mapped to
regular expressions. It applies all of the regexes to the current URI
and adds everything that matched to the 'param' list of the request
object.

Why?

With CGI::URI2param you can instead of:

 http://somehost.org/db?id=1234&style=fancy

present a nicerlooking URL like this:

 http://somehost.org/db/style_fancy/id1234.html

To achieve this, simply do:

 CGI::URI2param::uri2param($r,{
                                style => 'style_(\w+)',
                                id    => 'id(\d+)\.html'
                               });

Now you can access the values like this:

 my $id=$r->param('id');
 my $style=$r->param('style');

If you are using mod_perl, please take a look at Apache::URI2param.
It provides an Apache PerlInitHandler to make running CGI::URI2param
easier for you. Apache::URI2param is distributed along with
CGI::URI2param.
