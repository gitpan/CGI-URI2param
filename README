CGI::URI2param - convert parts of an URL to param values

DESCRIPTION

CGI::URI2param takes a request object (as supplied by CGI.pm or
Apache::Request) and a hashref of keywords mapped to
regular expressions. It applies all of the regexes to the current URI
and adds everything that matched to the 'param' list of the request
object.

Why?

With CGI::URI2param you can instead of:

 http://somehost.org/db?id=1234&style=fancy

present a nicerlooking URL like this:

 http://somehost.org/db/style_fancy/id1234.html

To achieve this, simply do:

 CGI::URI2param::uri2param($r,{
                                style => 'style_(\w+)',
                                id    => 'id(\d+)\.html'
                               });

Now you can access the values like this:

 my $id=$r->param('id');
 my $style=$r->param('style');

INSTALLATION

the standard way:

 perl Makefile.pl
 make
 make install

Currently there are no tests available.
